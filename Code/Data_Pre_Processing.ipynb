CKs were cycled.  The patient was held NPO and\\nfamily members were [**Name (NI) 653**].  The patient was continued on\\nLevofloxacin as started at the outside hospital and given\\ninhalers p.r.n.\\n\\nA psychiatry consultation was obtained on the morning of\\n[**2200-4-7**], given the patient's significant degree of\\ndisorientation and confusion and labile emotions.  The\\npsychiatrist's impression was that the patient was suffering\\nfrom delirium with waxing and [**Doctor Last Name 688**] mental status\\nexamination with poor memory.  At the time of the interview,\\nthe patient was agreeing to consider catheterization although\\nit was noted that if she changed her mind given the\\nimportance of this procedure that her husband and children\\nshould be [**Doctor Last Name 653**] regarding consent for the procedure and\\nthat her capacity to consent at that time should be held in\\nquestion.  Recommendations were made for Haldol p.r.n. as\\nwell as Xanax.  B12, folate, RPR and TSH were all ordered\\nwhich returned as normal.  The patient also had a head CT at\\nthe outside hospital which was unremarkable.\\n\\nCKs were sent at our hospital with initial level of CPK 464,\\nMB 12 and a troponin of 49 obtained.  The patient had been\\nplaced on Heparin prior to the anticipation of cardiac\\ncatheterization. The patient was initially consented to have\\ncardiac catheterization on [**2200-4-7**], although had an acute\\ndecompensation in mental status and anxiety attack and it was\\ndetermined that she would be at high risk for the procedure\\nat that time.  Thus, the procedure was deferred to the\\nmorning of [**2200-4-8**], and findings were as follows:\\n\\nLeft ventricular ejection fraction 62%.  Inferior\\nhypokinesis.  Normal valves.  Discrete proximal right\\ncoronary artery lesion of 100% stenosis.  Left main 100%\\ndiscrete stenosis.  Mid left anterior descending discrete\\n100% stenosis, 50% discrete midcircumflex stenosis.  Bypass\\ngraft saphenous vein graft to the right coronary artery was\\n100% discrete stenosis.  Left internal mammary artery to the\\nleft anterior descending patent and RIMA to the right\\ncoronary artery with a 40% stenosis.  No intervention was\\nperformed.\\n\\nIt was determined that the patient should be maximized on\\nmedical therapy only.  The patient was prescribed with\\nAspirin and Plavix at that time and given diuresis for\\nincreasing oxygen requirement.  The patient returned to the\\nfloor in stable condition and was to the Step-Down Cardiac\\nUnit on [**2200-4-8**].  The patient returned to baseline mental\\nstatus throughout the remainder of her hospital stay and was\\ndetermined to be in stable condition by [**2200-4-10**], to be\\ndischarged.

CT abdomen with\\nevidence of colitis but without other nidus for infection. C\\nDiff toxin returned positive which , given his symptoms, is\\nconsistent with a relapse of his prior infection. He was started\\non PO vancomycin and IV flagyl in the ICU. He remained afebrile\\nand his abdominal pain resolved. Initially a fever workup was\\nstarted given his asplenia and blood cultures revealed no growht\\nto date in the hospital.

The\\npatient was ultimately discharged on a total 14 days course of\\nPO Vanomycin and PO Metronidazole.  Major risk for initial C.\\nDiff infection is chemo and PPI therapy, and major risk for\\nrecurrent severe C. Diff colitis is PPI therapy during first\\ntreatment course.

Responded to IV\\nresuscitation. HR on discharge was in the 80s.\\n.\\n#. Leukocytosis: Likely secondary to underlying infection as\\nabove.  Trended down to 7.7 upon discharge with antibiotics\\n.\\n#. Metastatic Fibrosarcoma: CT abd/pelvis demonstrates multiple\\nmesenteric masses and R pararenal mass.

Right IJ Clot: secondary to intervention during last\\nhospitalization.  Patient on coumadin as an outpatient which was\\nheld initially as INR was supratherapeutic and patient was\\nstarted on abx. INR prior to d/c was 2. He will follow up with\\nhis outpatient providers to have INR monitoring while on\\nantibiotics.\\n.\\n#. Asplenia: fully vaccinated as outpatient. Unclear if has\\nprophylactic abx prescription at home but did not take it when\\nhe was febrile prior to admission. Will need f/u with PCP\\n[**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]:antibiotics for ppx in the future. Fever workup as above\\nrevealed no source other than C. Diff for infection.\\n.\\n#.

There are diffuse\\nhazy opacities and right lower lobe consolidation consistent\\nwith pneumonia. Bronchiectasis is noted with a lower lobe\\npredominance and most prominently involving the right lower\\nlobe. There is a 6 mm right upper lobe pulmonary nodule.\\nModerate right and small left pleural effusions are identified.\\nBONE WINDOWS: There are no suspicious lytic or sclerotic osseous\\nlesions.

Sternotomy wire seen\\noverlying the chest. Cardiac and mediastinal contours appear\\nwithin normal limits. There is increased opacity in the right\\nlower lobe. Small right upper lobe nodule also noted. Moderate\\nright sided and small left- sided pleural effusions also\\nidentified. Gastrostomy tube seen overlying the stomach.\\nIMPRESSION:\\n1. Increased opacity in the right lower lobe consistent with\\npneumonia. Moderate right and small left pleural effusions.\\n2. Small right upper lobe nodule. Followup imaging recommended\\nto document stability.\\n.\\nECG\\nProbable ectopic atrial rhythm\\nDiffuse ST-T wave changes - could be in part early\\nrepolarization pattern/\\nnormal variant but consider also pericarditis\\nNo previous tracing available for comparison\\n.\\nCTA CHEST W&W/O C&RECONS, NON-CORONARY  [**2133-2-18**] 4:01 PM\\nCT OF THE CHEST WITH AND WITHOUT IV CONTRAST. Study is limited\\nby streak artifact from patient's arm. There is no evidence of\\ncentral pulmonary embolism. No definite pulmonary emboli\\nidentified, although evaluation of the more distal vessels is\\nseverely limited.\\nThere has been interval increase in visualized bronchiectasis\\nwithin the upper segment of the right lower lobe, compared to\\nstudy from two days prior. Extensive bronchiectasis again noted\\nwithin the lower segment of the right lower lobe.\\nThere has been interval increase in the size of the right\\npleural effusion. Again seen are diffuse hazy opacities, as well\\nas focal consolidations within the lungs consistent with\\ninfection.\\nPulmonary nodules also again noted, not significantly changed in\\nappearance from the study performed two days prior.\\nBONE WINDOWS: No suspicious lytic or blastic lesions are\\nidentified.\\nIMPRESSION:\\n1. No evidence of central pulmonary embolism. Evaluation of more\\ndistal vessels severely limited by streak artifact.\\n2. Interval increase in visualized bronchiectasis at the upper\\nsegments of the right lower lobe. While this appearance might\\npartially be secondary to differences in respiratory phase,\\nthese findings raise concern for worsening infection. Extensive\\nbronchiectasis again noted in the lower segments of the right\\nlower lobe.\\n3. Worsened interval increase in right pleural effusion, focal\\nconsolidations again seen within both lungs consistent with\\ninfection.\\n4. Again seen are pulmonary nodules not significantly changed in\\nappearance from study performed two days prior.\\nFindings were discussed with Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 1852**] immediately\\nfollowing completion of the study.\\n.\\n[**Numeric Identifier **] PICC W/O PORT  [**2133-2-20**] 7:47 AM\\nPROCEDURE AND FINDINGS: As no suitable superficial veins were\\nvisible, ultrasound was used to localize a suitable vein. The\\nright brachial vein was patent and compressible. The right upper\\nextremity was prepped and draped in sterile fashion.\\nApproximately 5 cc 1% lidocaine was used for local anesthesia.\\nUnder direct ultrasonographic guidance, a 21-gauge needle was\\nadvanced into the right brachial vein and a 0.018 inch guidewire\\nwas advanced into the SVC under fluoroscopic guidance. Hard copy\\nultrasound images were obtained before and after venous access\\ndocumenting vessel patency. The needle was exchanged for a 5\\nFrench micropuncture sheath. Next it was determined that a\\nlength of 34 cm would be suitable. The 5 French double- lumen\\nPICC was trimmed to length and advanced over the wire into the\\nSVC under fluoroscopic guidance. The wire and peel-away sheath\\nwere removed. A final fluoroscopic spot image of the chest\\ndemonstrates the PICC line tip in the SVC. The line was flushed,\\nheplocked and statlocked. The patient tolerated the procedure\\nwell and there were no complications. IMPRESSION: Successful\\nplacement of right brachial PICC with the tip in the SVC. The\\nline is ready for views.\\n.\\n\\nCT ABDOMEN W/O CONTRAST  [**2133-2-21**] 2:29 PM\\nCT CHEST W/O CONTRAST; CT ABDOMEN W/O CONTRAST\\nCT OF THE CHEST WITH IV CONTRAST: The patient has a tracheostomy\\ntube, not well evaluated here. A right subclavian central venous\\ncatheter terminates in the superior vena cava. There is a small\\npericardial effusion. Contrast is visualized in a somewhat\\ndilated distal esophagus, although there is no wall thickening.\\nThere is a small 11-mm right hilar lymph node that is unchanged,\\nor perhaps a vascular structure such as a pulmonary venous\\nbranch.\\nThere is a 6-mm pulmonary nodule in the right upper lobe that is\\nunchanged. Continued followup as suggested previously is\\nrecommended. There has been interval improvement in patchy\\nconsolidation in the right lower lobe. Bronchiectasis is again\\nnoted in the right middle lobe and lingula.\\nA right-sided chest tube is present. There is a tiny\\npneumothorax tracking anteriorly.\\nSeveral lungs cysts are unchanged. Although less severe, there\\nare similar changes of bronchovascular thickening, patchy\\nconsolidation and bronchiectasis in the left lower lobe that is\\nlittle changed since the prior study. There is a similar small\\nleft pleural effusion, and a tiny right residual pleural\\neffusion.\\nCT OF THE ABDOMEN WITHOUT INTRAVENOUS CONTRAST: Within the\\nlimitations of a non-contrast study, the liver, gallbladder,\\npancreas, spleen are unremarkable.\\nThe left adrenal gland is unremarkable. The right adrenal gland\\nis poorly visualized.\\nThere is persistent contrast opacification of the renal cortices\\nbilaterally, presumably related to recent contrast bolus. This\\ncould be reflective of renal insufficiency. There is focal soft\\ntissue stranding about the right pararenal fascia. A gastrostomy\\ntube is positioned within the stomach. The proximal small bowel\\nis decompressed. Distally, the bowel is partly opacified and\\nappears normal.\\nThere is fluid throughout the colon, but no wall thickening.\\nThere is no evidence of lymphadenopathy or free air. There is a\\nsmall amount of ascites.\\nCT OF THE PELVIS WITHOUT IV CONTRAST: There is a Foley catheter\\nwithin the collapsed bladder. A few sigmoid diverticuli are\\npresent. The rectum is unremarkable. There is a small amount of\\nascites. The seminal vesicles are within normal limits. There is\\nno lymphadenopathy.\\nBONE WINDOWS: There are no suspicious lytic or blastic lesions.\\nIMPRESSION:\\n1. Persistent bibasilar predominantly peribronchial opacities\\nwith residual, but improved, consolidations.\\n2. Status post placement of right chest tube into right\\neffusion, which is considerably smaller. There is a miniscule\\npneumothorax, but this appearance is not surprising in the\\nsetting of recent chest tube placement\\n3. Fluid within the colon, but no wall thickening.\\n.\\nCHEST (PORTABLE AP)  [**2133-2-23**] 3:20 PM\\nPortable AP view of the chest dated [**2133-2-23**] is compared to the\\nprior from [**2133-2-20**]. Small bilateral pleural effusions are\\nstable. Right chest tube is again seen with its tip terminating\\nin the medial aspect of the right upper lobe. The patient is\\nstatus post lung transplant and bilateral median sutures are\\nagain noted. Tracheostomy tube is in place, with the tip\\napproximately 5 cm above the carina, unchanged. The heart size\\nis stable. The lungs are unchanged showing patchy bilateral\\nlower lung zone airspace opacities, right greater than left.\\nIMPRESSION: Stable appearance of the chest including stable\\nsmall bilateral pleural effusions and bilateral lower lobe\\npatchy opacities.\\n.\\nMicrobiology\\n[**2133-2-16**] 8:58 am BLOOD CULTURE      #2 LH.\\n\\n                            **FINAL REPORT [**2133-2-22**]**\\n\\n   AEROBIC BOTTLE (Final [**2133-2-22**]):    NO GROWTH.\\n\\n   ANAEROBIC BOTTLE (Final [**2133-2-22**]):    NO GROWTH.\\n[**2133-2-16**] 8:23 am BLOOD CULTURE\\n\\n                            **FINAL REPORT [**2133-2-22**]**\\n\\n   AEROBIC BOTTLE (Final [**2133-2-22**]):    NO GROWTH.\\n\\n   ANAEROBIC BOTTLE (Final [**2133-2-19**]):\\n      REPORTED BY PHONE TO [**Last Name (LF) **],[**First Name3 (LF) **] @ 12:30 [**2133-2-17**].\\n      STAPHYLOCOCCUS, COAGULASE NEGATIVE.

His hospital course is summarized below by problem.\\n.\\n# RESP FAILURE. Long standing lung disease, IPF dx in 96 s/p b/l\\nlung tx in [**2128**] c/b chronic rejection, requires chronic\\nventilatory support. Acute decompensation likely multifactorial\\nmainly secondary to pneumonia and mucous plugging. Aspiration is\\nalso likely. Patient was initially very difficult to ventilate\\nwith ABG showing 6.98/204/119 in the ED at which time he was\\nunresponsive. Upon arrival to the ICU he was placed on AC 280 x\\n22, FiO2 .70, Peep of 8. His arterial blood gases continued to\\nimprove over the course of his hospitalization. Our goals were\\nto keep his O2 sats >88%, PCO2 ~ 100. With these parameters he\\nwas mentating and following commands. His ventilation continued\\nto improve gradually with PCO2 ranging 70-80s.\\n.\\nPatient was iniated on broad coverage given h/o multiple drug\\nresitant organisms in the past. He as treated with Meropenem and\\nVancomycin. Vancomycin was discontinued on [**2-24**] per ID\\nrecommendations. He continues on Meropenem for a 14 week course\\n(started on [**2133-2-16**]). Influenza was negative. Patient had two\\nbronchoscopies performed during this admission, BAL from [**2-18**]\\ngrew Proteus Mirabilis resistant to quinolones. A Chest Tube was\\nplaced on [**2-19**] due to persistent pleural effusions and concern\\nfor loculation. It drained serosanguinous fluid, making criteria\\nfor exudate with LDH 336. It continued to drain fluid <200 cc\\nper day mainly serous. The chest tube was pulled on ... Patient\\nwas also continued on Prednisone 20 mg daily (trasiently on\\nstress dose steroids on admission) and his other\\nimmunosuppressant medications (see below). ID evaluated the\\npatient and recommened contiuing the same antibiotic coverage\\nand discontinuing vanco if he remained afebrile. C.diff was\\nchecked given loose stool which was negative. CMV viral load was\\npending at the time of discharge. Prior to discharge he was also\\ndiuresed with IV lasix to improve minimize drainage from his\\nchest tube and since he was markedly fuid overloaded since\\nadmission (positive 8.5 L since admission).\\n.\\nB-Glucan was positive; galactomannan was negative.  It is\\nunknown whether beta-glucan was due to fungal infection vs blood\\ntransfusion, antibiotic, or other.  Antifungal agents were not\\ngiven; however, ID consult recommended that he continue to be\\nmonitored with repeat beta-glucan assays drawn at Radius.\\n.\\n# Leukocytosis and Fever - SIRS, transiently hypotensive on\\nadmission which rapidly resolved. Likely secondary to pneumonia.\\nBlood cultures in the ED grew 1/4 bottles coag negative staph.\\nUrine cultures showed no growth. Patient remained hypertensive\\nthroughout the remained of his admission and restarted on a beta\\nblocker at high dose. He remained afebrile.\\n.\\n# Cardiovascular. Patient reportedly had pleuritic chest pain\\nthe day of admission prior to his acute respiratory decline. EKG\\nshowed early repolarization no acute ST-T changes. There was no\\nold EKG for comparison. Two sets cardiac enzymes are negative.\\nTelemetry subsequently showing frequent PVCs and few episodes of\\nNSVT. His beta blockade was increased to Metoprolol 100 mg q 8\\nhrs. His electrolytes were agressively replete to keep K >4 Mg\\n>2. He was continued on a statin. After this his telemetry was\\nnormal without further events.\\n.\\n# Pancreatitis. Patient complained of abdominal pain\\nintermittently. His abdomen was distended however he was making\\nstool and he was non tender on exam. CT of the abdomen showed a\\nnormal pancrease, gallbladder and spleen, fluid throughout the\\ncolon was noted but no bowel wall thickening. His PEG tube was\\nin good position. Amylase and lipase were elevated on [**2-21**] to\\n636 and 514 respectively. His tube feeds were stopped. There\\nenzymes trended down subsequently (see results). C.diff was\\nnegative. Tube feeds were restarted slowly and his amylase and\\nlipase started to increase.  GI was consulted and they\\nrecommended repositioning his feeding tube more distally.\\nPatient's feeding tube was successfully repositioned by\\ninterventional radiology on day of discharge.\\n.\\n# Anemia. Unclear etiology, initially 30-->21 today s/p two\\nunits pRBCs on [**2-19**], Hct 29 today and stable. Stool trace guaiac\\npositive. No evidence of hemolysis.\\n- active type and screen\\n- transfuse if <21\\n.\\n# s/p Lung Tx: Continue Prograf/Cellcept/Prednisone\\n- follow Tacrolimus level 6.3 [**2-23**]--check level in AM\\n- check level in AM\\n.\\n# DM - Humalog SS\\n.\\n# Polymyositis - stress dose steroids\\n.\\n# HTN.
